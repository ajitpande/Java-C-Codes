1.1 

program calls for recordPurchase method from CashReg Class. 0.75 purchase price was passed through it. This method calculated the total purchase price by this formula:
purchase = purchase + amount;

purchase variable is initialized as zero by constructor CashReg.

purchase = initial purchase + amount of purchase;
purchase = 0+0.75 = 0.75

And getTotal method from CashReg class was called upon which returns the value of purchase variable.

Then second time above methods were called upon, 1.5 amount another purchase

purchase=0.75+1.5 =2.25

total becomes= 2.25

then received payment method, adds up all the bills tendered by the customer by this formula:

 payment = (number of dollars) + (number of quarters * 0.25) + (number of dimes * 0.1)
            + (number of nickels * 0.05) + (number of pennies * 0.01);

then giveChange method was called upon,

change = payment â€“ purchase;
change = 2.5-2.25 = 0.25

then purchase and payment are initialized to zero and change value is returned.

1.2
Rounding errors occur when an exact representation of a floating-point number is not possible. The problem arises because computers represent numbers in the binary number system.

2.1
After modifying the code (in ex2 folder) so that calculations are done in cents while values are passed/returned as double, I still received the rounding error when 4.35 is passed through recordPurchase method. my compiler was recording it as 434.999999...4 and returning as 0.6500000....4. I did not find rounding error for other values of purchases. When I used Math.round method on 4.35 purchase price in recordPurchase method, rounding error for 4.35 purchase price did not show up.

I implemented two new methods in CashReg class as given in exercise 4, receivePayment(Change money) and Change giveChange(). Replaced the existing methods which were passing variables. After change, here is the result of two tester classes:
