List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written
with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do
not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,
i.e., the contents of the starter files for the assignment]

ANSWERS TO ASSIGNMENT README QUESTIONS (if applicable):

1. Course Textbook, 2.9, 2.10, 3,8, 6.9.1
Course Textbook Programming assignment Chapter 2 and 3.

2. At lower number of trials, Two Heads (15-20%), Two Tails(20-31%), A Heat-Tail (49 -65%)
At higher number of trials (more than 1000): Two Heads (24-25%), Two Tails(24-26%), A Heat-Tail (48-52%). 
Coin Toss results are independent to each other. In one trial, probability for HH will be 1/4, TT=1/4, HT/TH = 1/2 (4 event HH, TT, HT, TH). at higher trials, the results are matching with the probability calculated mathematically.

3.It is not consistent. On most number of trials the total adiition is 100%. I used Math.round method on all calculations. I tried about 10 times. For number of trial 125, the total is about !01%. When I tried again for 125 trials, total came out to 100%. So results are within +/-1%.

4. I tried 1,000,000,000 and it worked.It was slowed down and it took several seconds to run. It did not work at 9,000,000,000.
