ACKNOWLEDGE ANY OUTSIDE SOURCES

List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written
with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do
not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,
i.e., the contents of the starter files for the assignment]

I used few codes from textbook, specifically 2D array and how to access array element on arrays.





----------------------------------------------
KNOWN BUGS or LIMITATIONS:
I am receiving correct results in MineFieldTester and VisibleFieldTester classes. All results matches with expected in tester class. 
But when I am running MineSweeper.java, I am receiving following error:

Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 0
	at MineField.hasMine(MineField.java:171)
	at VisibleField.isGameOver(VisibleField.java:187)

I tried a lot and spent good amount of time but unfortunately, I have not resolved the error by the time of submission. I am finding it strange. I continue to resolve this bug. Strange that tester class is giving no error and .hasMine() and isGameOver() are working as expected.

ANY OTHER NOTES FOR THE GRADER:


None
